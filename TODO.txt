Hitbox checking
Remove printfs

There should be a launcher struct

...in hindsight I could have just had an entity linked list
	I could just use a union var in a struct

Maybe give hitpoints to each ball, so they do a little more damage?
Also, I can do the calculations for the closest square crosses to test more than one square.
	Instead of just checking the position, check the 4 corners.

Actually:
	Get the minimum and maximum x index
	Get the minimum and maximum y index
	Do a check for all in between these ranges to see if the radius hits


Need to add to plinko:
	pucks
	slots
	obstacles (pins)
